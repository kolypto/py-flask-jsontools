class JsonSerializableBase(object):
    """ Declarative Base mixin to allow objects serialization

        Defines interfaces utilized by :cls:ApiJSONEncoder

        In particular, it defines the __json__() method that converts the
        SQLAlchemy model to a dictionary. It iterates over model fields
        (DB columns and relationships) and collects them in the dictionary.

        The important aspect here is that it collects only loaded attributes.
        For example, all relationships are lazy-loaded by default, so they will
        not be present in the output JSON unless you use eager loading.
        So if you want to include nested objects into the JSON output, then
        you should use eager loading.

        Beside the __json__() method, this base defines two properties:
          _json_include = []
          _json_exclude = []

        They both are needed to customize this loaded-only-fields serialization.

          - _json_include is the list of strings (DB columns and relationship
           names) that should be present in JSON, even if they are not loaded.
           Useful for hybrid properties and relationships that cannot be loaded
           eagerly. Just put their names to the _json_include list.

          - _json_exclude is the black-list that actually removes fields from
            the output JSON representation. It is applied last, so it beats all
            other things like _json_include.
            Useful for hiding sensitive data, like password hashes stored in DB.
